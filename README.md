[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paulbutcher/ScalaMock.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/paulbutcher/ScalaMock) [![Scaladex](https://index.scala-lang.org/paulbutcher/scalamock/scalamock/latest.svg?color=orange)](https://index.scala-lang.org/paulbutcher/scalamock) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/d7250cea177b468c94bb07eb8d3366a4)](https://www.codacy.com/app/barkhorn/ScalaMock?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=paulbutcher/ScalaMock&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Native Scala mocking.

Official website: [scalamock.org](https://scalamock.org/)

## Examples

### Expectations-First Style

```scala
test("drawline interaction with turtle") {
  // Create mock Turtle object
  val m = mock[Turtle]
  
  // Set expectations
  (m.setPosition _).expects(10.0, 10.0)
  (m.forward _).expects(5.0)
  (m.getPosition _).expects().returning(15.0, 10.0)

  // Exercise System Under Test
  drawLine(m, (10.0, 10.0), (15.0, 10.0))
}
```

### Record-then-Verify (Mockito) Style

```scala
test("drawline interaction with turtle") {
  // Create stub Turtle
  val m = stub[Turtle]
  
  // Setup return values
  (m.getPosition _).when().returns(15.0, 10.0)

  // Exercise System Under Test
  drawLine(m, (10.0, 10.0), (15.0, 10.0))

  // Verify expectations met
  (m.setPosition _).verify(10.0, 10.0)
  (m.forward _).verify(5.0)
}
```

## Using ScalaMock

Artefacts are published to Maven Central and Sonatype OSS.

For ScalaTest, to use ScalaMock in your Tests, add the following to your `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += Seq("org.scalamock" %% "scalamock" % "4.4.0" % Test,
    "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "3.0.8" % Test)
```

## Documentation

For usage in Maven or Gradle, integration with Specs2, and more example examples see the [User Guide](http://scalamock.org/user-guide/)
